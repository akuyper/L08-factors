## Overview

The goal of this lab is to learn how to deal with factors in R, specifically within the tidyverse (although many of these methods can be applied with base R functions as well). Factors are used to work with categorical variables, or variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values. We'll use the `forcats` package, which provides tools for dealing with categorical variables. 

For more information on the `forcats` package, see [`forcats` tidyverse homepage](http://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html).

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L08_factors.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L08.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
